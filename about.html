				<p>Through hard work and perseverance, he was able to earn his brown belt under Alliance black belt Dragan Konjevic. Mike has over 10 years of learning, teaching and competing under his belt, yet he knew early on that teaching was his passion. </p>

<p>Mike has a very technical approach to BJJ which he shares with his students each class. He encourages everyone by showing them that time and effort on the mats helps us all get better. Mike is a leader by example, and one that you can count on to improve your game.</p>

				<p class="lead mt-20">His detail oriented style of teaching made him a perfect fit for the Guardhouse team. </p>
				<p>Kevin's journey into BJJ began in 2010, and he was awarded his purple belt in 2014. Kevin is an accomplished competitor, and is always pushing his training partners to their limit. </p>

<p>Hard work is the name of the game with Kevin, and he isn't scared of getting sweaty. While he is teaching, he expects 100% from his students, because he's always giving that much himself. If improving your fitness is a major goal, make sure you never miss one of his classes.</p>

<p>After his matches, Tony can be found cornering our members, ensuring they have a friendly face and high level coaching while they are competing. At the club, he teaches his unique mix of speed and pressure passing, along with his deadly choke arsenal, challenging students to take their training to the next level. No matter what your style is, Tony will have something to help you improve your game.</p>
